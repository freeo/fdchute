* TODO
** WIP Streaming ordered output
output level 0+1 first, before continuing to sort stuff

** catching bad uses
expect input, else abort
display help
** caching
** Ordering:
take parameters from ranger, so that files have the exact same order in tv and ranger
** DONE ignore common cache files
.git/
pnpm
python pycache
etc.
** DONE streaming to STDOUT, async TV read
every finished, sorted folder level should be streamed to the buffer/pipe which television is reading from (if this is possible)
tv already supported this! Just need to write (flush) periodically
